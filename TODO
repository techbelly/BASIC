• Multidimensional arrays:
  10 DIM A(10,20)
  20 A(1,2) = 4
  
• Steps in FOR loops:
  10 FOR I= 1 TO 10 STEP -1
  20 NEXT I

• Array bounds checking and other error handling.

• ELSE in IF statement
  10 IF A>B THEN GOTO 50 ELSE GOTO 20

• Multiple statement lines
  10 FOR I=1 TO 20: NEXT I

I think that's it for a simple interpreter. Much refactoring and fun should follow.

Staying clear of graphics for now, but should do something eventually.
